How to scale the project 
Project Structure:

Organize your codebase for better maintainability. Here's a common structure:
app.py: The main Flask application file.
forms.py: Define form classes with validation logic (using Flask-WTF).
models.py: Define database models (using SQLAlchemy).
routes.py: Group related routes for better organization.
templates folder: Store HTML templates with Jinja2 syntax.
index.html: Main template.
includes folder (optional): Store reusable template components.
static folder: Store static assets like CSS, Javascript and images.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement proper error handling with custom error pages and logging mechanisms. Use libraries like Flask-Sentry for advanced error reporting.
Configuration:

Move configuration options (database connection string, secret keys) to a separate configuration file (e.g., .env or config.py).
Testing:

Write unit tests for your Flask routes, forms, and logic with a framework like pytest.
Deployment:

Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn instead of the built-in development server.
Consider containerization with Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
Explore cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy deployment and scaling options.
Additional Considerations:

Database Management: Use a production-grade database like PostgreSQL and connect with SQLAlchemy.
Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization with libraries like Flask-Login or Flask-JWT.
Background Tasks: Utilize Celery or RQ for handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending emails, processing data).
Caching: Consider using a caching mechanism like Flask-Caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
API Documentation: Utilize tools like Swagger or ReDoc to generate API documentation for your app.
